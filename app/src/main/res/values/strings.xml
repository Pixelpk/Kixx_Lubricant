    <string name="howtochoosebestoilformycar">How to choose best oil for my car?</string>
    <string name="rightoilselection">Selecting the right engine oil can be challenging for most of us. Multiple types, different numbers, letters, variant grades, and viscosity are available in the market. So, how to select the right one? Will it be ideal for the current weather conditions? How long will it last before a change is recommended? Is it ok to mix them up?

Seems like quite a challenging decision to make!  That’s why we usually leave it to the mechanic to recommend one for us.

But not to worry, in this article, we will guide you to pick the right oil for your car.

What kind of oil you need depends on the engine. All new cars will come with a recommended grade listed in the car manual. The grade will be shown in numbers, separated by the letter ‘w’ – for example, 5w40. “The ‘w’ rating, preceded by a number, gives you an indication of how the oil flows (Viscosoty) at winter temperatures and the last number indicates flow (Viscosity) in summer temperatures.”

Not all engine oils are the same. It is important to choose an oil that is suited to your car and local climate conditions to enjoy all its benefits. Following are the main types of oil:
\n\n
"Mineral Oil:

Mineral oil, also known as “conventional oil”, is the most basic &amp; affordable type of engine oils, obtained from refined petroleum crude oil.

Mineral oil is thicker than other oil types which causes a slower flow rate that results in increased fuel consumption.

Mineral engine oils are less resistant to high temperatures and oxidation compared to synthetic engine oils, and have higher liquid points, which makes them favorable for winter conditions and extremely low temperatures.

And because of that, mineral oils require frequent oil changes, after every 5,000 kilometers or every four months.
\n\n"
"Synthetic Oil:
\n

Synthetic oil is a product of complex chemical transformations that are performed either directly on drilled crude petroleum or using preselected molecules. It undergoes more sophisticated modification.They hold many advantages:
 - Synthetics dont break down or sludge up as fast as ordinary mineral-based oils do. In other words, it has less deposit formation which leads to cleaner engines.
- Better engine protection that increases its health &amp; life span
- Stable flow performance &amp; viscosity during extreme temperatures
- Fuel consumption optimization
And not to forget, one of its main perks is that it requires less frequent oil changes. Synthetic oil can last between 8,000 to 15,000 kilometers or every six months before its next change.

However, the main disadvantage of synthetic oils that makes the least favorite to people is that they are slightly more expensive.
 \n\n"
"Semi-Synthetic Oil:

\n
Semi-Synthetic oil is also known as synthetic blends &amp; as hybrid lubricants; is a mixture of mineral and synthetic oils that reserves the best features of both oils.

Semi-synthetic oils can be the best choice for engines that encounter heavy loads caused by intensive usage.

Semi-synthetic oil is more of a wallet-friendly than fully synthetic oil as they are of a lower cost. While getting some benefits of the fully-synthetic oil, it can be your next best choice."
\n\n
"Did You Ever Wondered??
Have you ever looked at the engine oil bottle and wondered what all these numbers and letters stand for? There are many different ways in describing motor oils, each refers to a certain standard of classification. ​​​​​Here are the three standards used for describing the oils:
 - The API standard
 - The SAE standard
 - The ACEA standard
You can get more detailed information of all these standards and lubricants info on below link of our website"

    <!-- FAQ 7 -->

    <string name="faq_ques_7">When do I have to change the car oil?</string>
    <string name="faq_ans_7">
        Depending on vehicle age, type of oil and driving conditions, oil change intervals will vary. It used to be normal to change the oil every 3,000 miles, but with modern lubricants most engines today have recommended oil change intervals of 5,000 to 7,500 miles.
        Moreover, if your car engine requires full-synthetic motor oil, it might go as far as 10,000 miles between services!
        You cannot judge engine oil condition by color, so follow the factory maintenance schedule for oil changes.
        Tip: early oil change enhances the life of your engine and saves cost on a longer run.
